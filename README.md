# Manipulating_Data_with_Pandas
Pandas is an open source data structures and data analysis tool for Python. 

What problem does pandas solve? 
It allows user to carry out their entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.

Some [Library highlights](https://pandas.pydata.org):
- A fast and efficient **DataFrame** object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;
- Tools for **reading and writing** data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format;
- Intelligent **data alignment** and integrated handling of **missing data**: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;
- Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets;
- Intelligent label-based **slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting** of large data sets;
- Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for **size mutability**;
- Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful **group by** engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;
- High performance **merging and joining** of data sets;
- **Hierarchical axis indexing** provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;
- **Time series**-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data;
- Python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.
